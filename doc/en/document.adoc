Quick Start is a simple example, if you want to do more detailed configuration, you can refer to this document

== 1. Generate

The purpose of this step is to generate Metadata that conforms to the Maven standard.

Medivh-Publish Encapsulates the link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html[maven-publish] plugin of Gradle to achieve this function

If you have not import this plugin, Medivh-publisher will automatically help you import it, you do not need to do any configuration.

===  Relationship with Maven-Publish

If you have already used the Maven-Publish plugin configuration, Medivh-Publish will automatically use your configuration, you do not need to do any additional configuration.

> If you do not fill in the Maven-Publish plugin configuration completely, Medivh-Publish will help you fill in the default values, and will output a warning message on the console.

=== Configuration priority

Medivh-Publish > Maven-Publish > Default value

This is very similar to the Maven-Publish configuration

> Medivh-Publish guarantees that you will not make mistakes no matter how you configure it, because Medivh-Publish will help you fill in the default values, but it is still recommended that you check your configuration for omissions.

=== Configuration details

In Sonatype's link:https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements[Document]，the Pom Xml required to be pulished must contain the following configuration:

The configuration is populated granularly to each attribute configured.
For example:

The Scm information must contain `connection` and `url` attributes.
If you have configured `connection` but not `url`, Medivh-Publish will still help you fill in the other attribute.

> If you have manually configured these parameters, even if they are empty, Medivh-Publish will use your configuration and will not override the default values, unless null is set, because this is illegal in Maven.

==== 1 Source and Doc

``Medivh-Publish`` upload source and doc by default, if you don't need it, you can configure it in build.gradle:

[source,kotlin]
----
medivhPublisher{
    withoutJavaDocJar()
    withoutSourcesJar()
}
----

Configuration is equivalent to:

[source,kotlin]
----
java {
    withJavadocJar()
    withSourcesJar()
}
----

==== 2 Singing

The purpose of this configuration is to get the signing file required by Maven

Medivh-Publish encapsulates the link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html#signing_plugin[signing] plugin of Gradle to achieve this function, generally no special configuration is required

> You need to make sure that you have configured the necessary information. link:./gpg_guide.adoc[Gpg Guide]

==== 3 correct coordinate

The purpose of this configuration is to get the correct coordinate required by Maven Like``com.example:my-library:1.0.0``

Default configuration value in Medivh-Publish:

``groupId = project.group``

``artifactId = project.name``

``version = project.version``

==== 4 Project Info 

Contains three attributes: ``name``, ``description``, ``url``

Medivh-Publish默认会把

`name = project.name`

`description = project.description`

Medivh-Publish will get your git remote url as the value of url, otherwise it will fill in an empty string

`url =  gitRemoteUrl or empty`

==== 5 License

The License default value is empty string

==== 6 Developer Info

Developer Info contains three attributes: `id`, `name`, `email`

email  `git config user.email`

id   `git config user.name`

==== 7 SCM信息

SCM contains `connection` and  `url`

Medivh-Publish will get your git remote url as the value of url, otherwise it will fill in an empty string
