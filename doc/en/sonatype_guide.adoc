= Sonatype Configuration Guide ðŸ“„

1. Register an account on https://central.sonatype.com/ (if you donâ€™t have one).

2. Create a namespace on https://central.sonatype.com/publishing/namespaces. The purpose of this step is to prove that you own a domain name that can be published (which will eventually be the `groupId` of the published Maven repository). You can directly use GitHub's domain name, like: `io.github.your-username`.

3. Create a token on https://central.sonatype.com/account. This token will be used to authenticate the user when uploading the artifacts to the Maven Central Repository. You will get something like this:

[source,xml]
----
<server>
  <username>username</username>
  <password>password</password>
</server>
----

Remember the `username` and `password`. For security reasons, we store this token in Gradleâ€™s local configuration file (usually located at `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`).

[source,properties]
----
sonatypeUsername=username
sonatypePassword=password
----

Alternatively, provide an environment variable:

[source,shell]
----
sonatypeUsername=username
sonatypePassword=password
----

*ðŸ’¯ You have completed all the Sonatype configurations.*
